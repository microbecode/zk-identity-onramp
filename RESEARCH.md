This document describes the research days spent on this project.

## 5th of March

Started researching the project. Started looking on creating a JWT token with just JS with Google. It seems it requires access to Google Cloud Console, which requires one to enter all sorts of details (such as credit card). Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but in this phase of the project it is assumed that the authentication tokens are leaked, so need to use empty accounts. Wouldn't want to associate real credit cards with accounts that get compromised.

It seems to be difficult to find a popular identity provider that allows to recreate the auth flow without selling one's soul (or giving credit card info).
